"""Every site under `websites/` must declare, and be able to resolve, what it imports.

The demo site is the only consumer of these packages that ships inside this repo,
and CI does not build it. `web-tests.yml` installs and builds `packages/web` and
runs its suites; `websites/` is in the workflow's path filter but nothing in the
job ever enters it. So the one place a reader looks to see the library actually
used is also the one place no automated check has ever looked.

That matters more here than it would in a repo that had always owned these
packages. Eight of them arrived from a private repo under a different scope, and
the demo site's manifest was repointed by hand as part of that arrival. A repoint
has exactly two ways to go wrong, and this guard is the two of them:

  a `file:` specifier that resolves nowhere
      The manifest names `file:../../packages/web/packages/chat`. If that package
      is later renamed or moved, `pnpm install` fails inside `websites/demo` —
      which no job runs, so the break is invisible until a human opens the demo.

  a specifier that resolves to the WRONG package
      Worse, because it installs cleanly. A path that lands on a real directory
      whose package.json declares a different name gives the site a package it
      did not ask for under a name it did. Checking the target's declared `name`
      against the dependency key is what separates "a directory exists there"
      from "the right package is there".

  an import of a package the manifest does not declare
      The mirror failure: source that imports `@agenticdevelopertoolkit/ui` while
      the manifest declares only `chat` and `themes`. In a workspace with a
      hoisted node_modules this resolves anyway, from some other package's
      dependency, and keeps resolving right up until that package drops it.

Only the scopes this repo publishes are checked for declaration. A bare `react`
or `next` is somebody else's dependency graph and this guard has no opinion about
it; `@agenticdevelopertoolkit/*` is the graph this repo is responsible for.

Exit 0 clean, 1 on a finding, 2 if there was nothing to scan — no site manifests
found means the layout moved out from under this guard, and a guard that scans
nothing must never report a pass.
