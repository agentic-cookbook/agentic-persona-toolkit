"""A documented subpath must be one the package's `exports` map actually exports.

Task 9's review found three `controls` READMEs instructing the reader to
`import '@agenticdevelopertoolkit/controls/filtered-list/styles/filtered-list.css'`.
That is the path the `exports` map points AT (`dist/filtered-list/styles/filtered-list.css`),
not the subpath it EXPORTS (`./filtered-list/styles.css`) — following the README's
version raises `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. No compiler reads a README, and the
scope name was perfectly correct, so nothing caught it until a human read the file.

A second, sharper shape of the same defect shipped in `chat`'s README: five lines
named the package `@agentic-cookbook/agenticdevelopertoolkit/chat` — an invented
scope, not a bad subpath. Neither existing gate could see it. The private-scope
guard (`check_no_private_scope.py`) searches for the literal string
`@agentic-toolkit/` and this string does not contain it. A by-hand sweep keyed on
the package's real name (`@agenticdevelopertoolkit/chat`) misses it for the same
reason in reverse: the bogus prefix means the correct name never appears in the
file for the sweep to find. So this guard does not search prose for a known-bad
string either — it starts from each package's OWN manifest name, finds every place
its short name shows up as a path segment in that package's docs, and checks
whether the specifier surrounding it is what the manifest says it should be.

## What counts as a hit

For every `@agenticdevelopertoolkit/*` package discovered under `--root`, scan its
markdown for a quoted string or backtick span containing `<basename>` as a path
segment (`/<basename>` followed by `/` or end-of-string) and inspect what precedes
it:

  * the text before `/<basename>` is not exactly `@agenticdevelopertoolkit`, and
    the text contains "agenticdevelopertoolkit" somewhere — a real attempt to name
    this package that got the scope wrong. Reported as a wrong-scope finding.
  * the prefix IS `@agenticdevelopertoolkit` and a subpath follows — the subpath
    must match one of the package's own `exports` keys.
  * the prefix does not match and the text never mentions "agenticdevelopertoolkit"
    at all — a genuine third party whose name happens to share this package's
    basename (e.g. some unrelated `.../chat/...`). This guard has no exports map
    for a third-party package and must not invent one, so it is skipped.

## Wildcards are real

`ui` exports `"./components/*"` and `"./blocks/*"`. A subpath is matched against
export keys with `fnmatch`, never as a set-membership test — the set form would
report `ui/components/button` as broken when it resolves fine.

Exit 0 clean, 1 on a finding, 2 on an empty scan (no `@agenticdevelopertoolkit/*`
packages found, or none of them ship any markdown) — an empty scan is never a
pass, it is a guard that scanned nothing and has no business reporting clean.

Fix a finding by correcting the prose to match the manifest, never by widening the
manifest to match the prose — widening grows a public package's API surface on
the strength of a typo.
