"""Every repo-relative `docs/…md` or `recipes/…md` citation in this repo must resolve,
and so must every `agenticdeveloperhub://recipes/<slug>` citation — the recipe corpus's
own cross-reference scheme, used in `domain:` (self-resolving), `ingredients:`/`related:`
frontmatter lists, and an ingredient table's Domain column.

AND every repo-relative citation of a SOURCE path made from inside `docs/` or `recipes/`.

That last clause is the widening, and it is worth saying why. The `.md`-only regex was
honest about its scope and completely green while 42 recipe citations pointed at
`websites/shared/ui/…` — a directory tree that does not exist in this repo at all; the
files live at `packages/web/packages/ui/…`. A recipe's "Platform Notes" section is almost
entirely source-path citations, so the one part of a recipe most likely to rot was the one
part this guard could not see. A dangling `.tsx` misleads a reader exactly as much as a
dangling `.md` does.

The false-positive risk that kept the original scope narrow is real: prose is full of
path-shaped strings that are not citations into this repo (`src/foo.ts` in an example
snippet, `your-app/pages/index.tsx` in an integration walkthrough, `and/or`). The
containment is a single rule: a source-path citation is only checked when its FIRST
SEGMENT is a real top-level directory of the scanned root. `websites/shared/ui/x.tsx` is
checked because `websites/` exists here; `src/foo.ts` and `your-app/x.ts` are not checked
at all, because nothing in this repo could ever have been meant by them.

Three shapes are skipped even under a real top-level directory, because none of them is
a coordinate anyone can follow or fix: a `...` elision segment, a `*` glob, and a `..`
parent hop.

The scope guard is a denylist and knows the private scope's name; this is the complement.
It asks only whether a reader following the citation lands on a file, which is the property
that actually matters and the one that survives the private repo being renamed.

Exit 0 clean, 1 dangling citations found, 2 nothing scanned.
