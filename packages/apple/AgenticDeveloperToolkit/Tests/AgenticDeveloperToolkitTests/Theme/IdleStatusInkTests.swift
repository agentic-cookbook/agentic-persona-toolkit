/// Two roles render the same shape of line — a glyph, then a phrase — and mean
/// opposite things: `.thinkingDoneText` is a report ("thought for 8s"),
/// `.thinkingIdleText` is a shrug ("waiting to zeeble…"). Nothing in the
/// layout distinguishes them, so the colour has to, and these tests are what
/// keep them from collapsing back into one value.
