/// focus colour, and `old-school-terminal` in particular asks for a
/// transparent fill under a green rule that brightens on focus. A bezel cannot
/// express any of that — AppKit draws the bezel, and `backgroundColor` under
/// it is simply not visible — so this field turns the bezel off and paints its
/// own layer instead.
