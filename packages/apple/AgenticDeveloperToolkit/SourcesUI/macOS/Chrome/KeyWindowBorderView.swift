/// only signal a chromeless window has left to say "you are typing into *me*":
/// the same line, brighter.
///
/// Overlaid rather than set as the content view's `layer.borderColor` because a
/// layer border is drawn *inside* the layer's bounds on all four sides at full
/// opacity and cannot be inset by the half point that keeps a 1-point stroke
/// from straddling the pixel grid. It is also click-through — `hitTest` always
/// answers `nil` — so nothing underneath loses a mouse event to it.
