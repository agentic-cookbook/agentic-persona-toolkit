    `interpreter()` above pins the generator itself, and that used to be the whole story —
    but generation does not end when openapi-python-client returns. Its `post_hooks` are
    shell commands (`ruff check --fix`, `ruff format .`), and a bare `ruff` resolves from
    PATH, so the LAST stage of generation ran under whatever ruff the machine happened to
    have installed rather than the `ruff==0.13.3` pyproject pins beside the generator.

    That is not hypothetical: the committed tree under `src/apt_terminal/generated/` is
    0.16.0 output while the venv holds 0.13.3, because a Homebrew ruff sat ahead of the
    venv on PATH. The pin was real, the venv was correct, and the hook walked straight past
    both — which is exactly the drift the pin exists to prevent, arriving through the one
    door it did not cover.

    Prepending the venv's bin closes it for every hook tool at once, so the config file can
    go on naming plain `ruff` (it is also what the hook would resolve to inside an activated
    venv, which is how anyone running this by hand would expect it to behave).
