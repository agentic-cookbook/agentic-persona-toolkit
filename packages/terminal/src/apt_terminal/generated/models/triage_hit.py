    Attributes:
        id (str):
        project_id (str):
        project_name (str): the OWNING board’s name — a queue spanning boards is undecidable without it, and the client
            cannot join it itself.
        item_key (str): the rendered key (`ADH-42`)
        title (str):
        description (str):
        status_id (str): the column the card was FILED into. It is not a decision anyone has made yet — that is
            precisely what triage withholds — but an intake form that files by category has already said something worth
            showing.
        priority (int): rank, 0 (none) to 4 (urgent); higher is more urgent
        priority_scale (TriageHitPriorityScale): whether the OWNING board ranks its work — 'none' means show no priority
            for this row. Carried per row for the same reason projectName is: the queue spans boards, so the client has no
            single project to read it off. The board's item NOUN is deliberately absent: a queue mixing recipes and stories
            has no single word for what it holds.
        created_at (str): when it arrived; the queue is ordered by this, oldest first
