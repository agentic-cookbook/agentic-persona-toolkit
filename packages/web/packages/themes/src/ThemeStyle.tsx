// Full-palette themes — every theme with a complete M3 role layer — anchor their token
// blocks at `html:root` (dark, the default) and `html:root[data-color-mode]:not(.dark)`
// (light). The `:root` patterns below cannot see either: their `:root` is preceded by
// `html`, not by a line start or a comma. Without these two the whole palette of every
// full-palette theme is dropped in scoped mode and the scope silently keeps the host page's
// colours — the failure looks like "the theme did nothing", with no error anywhere.
//
// QUALIFIED before bare: an anchor may carry any run of document-state qualifiers —
// `[data-color-mode]:not(.dark)`, `[data-contrast='high']`, or both at once (a dark-always
// theme like fishlamp names every combination it has to out-specify). Those qualifiers
// describe the DOCUMENT, not the scoped element, so they move onto an `html` ancestor and
// the scope descends from it. Matching only the one light form left every other shape
// unrewritten — and rewrote `html:root[data-color-mode]:not(.dark)[data-contrast='high']`
// to `… :scope[data-contrast='high']`, hanging a document attribute on the scoped element,
// where it matches nothing. Both failures are silent; buildScopedCss.test.ts's last case
// asserts against the real stylesheets so a new anchor shape fails there instead.
//
// The anchor may also be INDENTED — a rule nested in an `@media (prefers-contrast: more)`
// block is the case that exists — so each pattern opens at a line start plus any leading
// horizontal whitespace, not at the line start alone. `[ \t]*` and not `\s*`: the latter
// eats newlines, which would let one match swallow a preceding blank line.

// measured against src/styles: dracula.css is typical — a 91-declaration `html:root`
// dark block followed by an 85-declaration `html:root[data-color-mode]:not(.dark)`
// light block). Its qualifier is EXACTLY the color-mode discriminator, `[data-color-
// mode]:not(.dark)`, and — the part that matters here — it is the ENTIRE selector of
// its OWN rule (immediately followed by `{`). That second condition is what colorMode
// used to ignore: this pattern is textually indistinguishable from one comma-list item
// among several UNLESS the lookahead for `{` (not `,`) is checked too, and two shipped
// themes (charcoal.css, fishlamp.css — "dark-always", no light palette) share exactly
// this discriminator as one item in a combined `html:root, html:root[data-color-mode]
// :not(.dark), …[data-contrast=…] { }` list. Matching the discriminator alone would
// rewrite THAT occurrence as well and hand those themes a light variant they don't
// have — the regression this anchor is scoped, by construction, to avoid.
