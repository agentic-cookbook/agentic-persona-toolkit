// Self-contained config so `pnpm --filter @agenticdevelopertoolkit/registry-types

// the workspace-root config but keeps cwd as its root, so the root's
// `dir: './packages'` resolves to <this package>/packages — which does not
// exist, and the run finds nothing. That silence used to be masked by
// `--passWithNoTests` on the test script: three real test files, a green exit,
// zero of them run. We reuse the root setup file for its deterministic
// jest-dom/localStorage/ResizeObserver/matchMedia shims.
