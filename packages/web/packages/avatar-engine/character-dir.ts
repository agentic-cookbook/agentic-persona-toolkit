/** The character config bundled with the engine, used when no other is reachable.
 *
 *  A byte-for-byte copy of `whatsnow-toolkit/characters/olylo`'s six JSON files
 *  — everything except the `goldens/` beside them, which run to 93MB of
 *  recorded frames and belong with the tool that records them. The copy is not
 *  allowed to drift: `character-dir.test.ts` beside it diffs it against the
 *  real directory on every run that can see one, which is every run inside
 *  whatsnow-toolkit.
 *
 *  A synthetic character would be the tidier fixture, and it is what the Swift
 *  half bundles (`AvatarAnimationEngine/Tests/Fixtures/dot`). It cannot be used
 *  here: the TypeScript tests were written against olylo and assert its
 *  numbers, its pose names and its exact path strings — 104 of 249 fail against
 *  `dot`. Porting them to a synthetic rig is a change to twelve test files this
 *  copy deliberately does not make. */

/** Where the character config the tests load lives.
 *
 *  Three sources, in priority order:
 *
 *  1. `CHARACTER_DIR` in the environment — an explicit override, for pointing
 *     the suite at a character that is neither bundled nor an ancestor.
 *  2. `characters/olylo` in an ancestor directory. This repo is checked out
 *     inside `whatsnow-toolkit`, and in the olylo superproject it is checked out
 *     TWICE at two different depths: once for the web app (nested under
 *     `whatsnow-toolkit/packages/web/external/`) and once for the Apple app (a
 *     sibling at the superproject root). A fixed run of `..` segments is
 *     therefore correct in exactly one of the two and resolves to a directory
 *     that does not exist in the other — which fails twelve test files with
 *     nothing but "Cannot find package '@character/character.json'", and looks
 *     for all the world like a broken source tree. Searching upward is correct
 *     in both, and finds the REAL directory — goldens included — wherever one
 *     exists, so the parity run inside whatsnow-toolkit is unaffected by the
 *     bundled copy.
 *  3. The bundled fixture. This used to THROW instead, which made the suite
 *     unrunnable in this repo's own CI: `web-tests.yml` checks out
 *     agenticdevelopertoolkit alone, and whatsnow-toolkit is a *parent* of it,
 *     never a submodule, so there is no ancestor to find and not one test was
 *     ever collected. A library whose tests only run inside one particular
 *     superproject is a library nobody outside that superproject can change. */
