   * from the page itself: an anonymous visitor is served a strictly smaller entry than a
   * signed-in one and has no way to tell, and a registrant checking their own live profile
   * while signed in would otherwise read the wider page as the public one.
   *
   * Never a licence to render and hide. The server strips — a field this viewer is not
   * admitted to has no entry in `fields` at all — so `'private'` cannot appear here, and
   * `'authenticated'` only ever arrives in a response that was itself served to a signed-in
   * reader. Hiding in CSS would leave the value in the markup where View Source finds it.
