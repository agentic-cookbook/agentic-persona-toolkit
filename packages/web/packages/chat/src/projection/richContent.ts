/**
 * Web-only display extras — link/image cards, a detail popover, a record of
 * the tool calls a reply made — carried through the contract as a single
 * inline attachment.
 *
 * The contract's message vocabulary is deliberately portable: text,
 * attachments, delivery status. `PopoverData` is not portable and never will
 * be — no Swift or Kotlin UI is going to render a `.pc-popover-toggle`. But
 * `ThreePaneChat` builds its entire topic pane out of `msg.popover`, and
 * `InlineChat` renders a popover per bubble, so these have to survive the trip
 * from a `ChatBackend` through the orchestrator to the bubble that draws them.
 *
 * They ride as one `Attachment` under a vendor media type rather than as
 * fields on `Message`, because that is the shape a platform which does not
 * recognise the identifier can ignore without knowing anything about it.
 * `AttachmentPresentation` is `'inline'` for the same reason: it is part of
 * the message, not a file hanging off it.
 *
 * Encoding the whole payload as JSON rather than mapping links onto
 * `AttachmentSource.remote` is deliberate. `remote` holds a parsed `URL`, and
 * a relative `src` — which `ImageContent` plainly permits — has no absolute
 * form until something supplies a base. Lossless beats semantically tidy for a
 * payload whose only reader is the bubble it came from.
