/**
 * "This field is not a credential" — a copy of `@agentic-toolkit/ui/lib/autofill`,
 * which is the list of record. `frontend/tools/verify_autofill_copies.py` in the
 * adh repo is what keeps them in step.
 *
 * This site is its own workspace and does not depend on the UI kit, so the
 * attributes are repeated here rather than imported. Each vendor reads its own
 * attribute and none of them read the others; `autocomplete="off"` alone moves
 * none of them, because it speaks only to the browser's own autofill:
 *
 *   - `data-form-type="other"`      Dashlane (its SAWF "ignore" value)
 *   - `data-1p-ignore`              1Password 8
 *   - `data-lpignore`               LastPass
 *   - `data-bwignore`               Bitwarden
 *   - `data-protonpass-ignore`      Proton Pass
 *   - `autocomplete="off"`          the browser (Chrome/Safari/Firefox autofill)
 *
 * Keeping them out is not only cosmetic: several managers *mutate the DOM* to
 * plant their button (Dashlane adds `data-dashlane-rid`), and a mutation that
 * lands between SSR and hydration is a React hydration mismatch.
